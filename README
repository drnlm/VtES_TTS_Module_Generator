Tabletop Simulator VtES module generator
----------------------------------------


This generates a TTS module for building VtES decks, building on the base provided by the
maintainers of the VtES full cards module - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1955001917

Usage

`python3 create_tts_mod.py [vtes.json]`

This creates a file calles VtES_TTS.json, which can be placed in the `Mods/Workshop` folder.

The module uses the card data and cards images provided by https://static.krcg.org/ .

By default, the program will download the vtes.json file from https://static.krcg.org/data/vtes.json ,
but it is possible to provide your own json file as an input parameter for including custom cards
and so on. We only use the 'name', 'id', 'types' and 'url' fields from the KRCG json file, but all these
fields need to be present on each card.
